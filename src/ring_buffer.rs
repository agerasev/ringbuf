/// An abstract ring buffer.
///
/// # Details
///
/// The ring buffer consists of an array (of `capacity` size) and two indices: `read` and `write`.
/// When an item is extracted from the ring buffer it is taken from the `read` index and after that `read` is incremented.
/// New item is appended to the `write` index and `write` is incremented after that.
///
/// The `read` and `write` indices are modulo `2 * capacity` (not just `capacity`).
/// It allows us to distinguish situations when the buffer is empty (`read == write`) and when the buffer is full (`write - read` modulo `2 * capacity` equals to `capacity`)
/// without using the space for an extra element in container.
/// And obviously we cannot store more than `capacity` items in the buffer, so `write - read` modulo `2 * capacity` is not allowed to be greater than `capacity`.
